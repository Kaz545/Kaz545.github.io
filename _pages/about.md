I am originally from Pakistan, raised in the vibrant city of Gujranwala. I completed my bachelor’s degree in Economics and Mathematics with a minor in Computer Science at LUMS, where my passion for data science truly ignited. Later, while working at Afiniti, I earned a master’s degree in Analytics from Georgia Tech, further enhancing my expertise in the field.

Currently, I am based in Türkiye, working as a Senior Data Scientist at Afiniti, where I have been for over 4.5 years. My role involves developing and optimizing machine learning models to enhance customer interactions in call center environments, reducing churn, and boosting sales for our clients. Outside of work, I enjoy playing tennis and cricket, staying active through workouts, and unwinding with Netflix. I am also passionate about community service; during my time at LUMS, I was an active member of the Community Service Society, leading initiatives to make a positive impact.
